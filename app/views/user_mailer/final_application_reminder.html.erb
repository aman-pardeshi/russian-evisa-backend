      <p>Dear <%= @user.name %>,</p>

      <p>
        It looks like your Russian eVisa application hasnâ€™t been completed yet.
        We wanted to give you a final opportunity to reactivate and submit your
        application.
      </p>

      <p>
        <%= link_to "Click here to reactivate your application",
        "#{ENV.fetch("FRONTEND_URL")}/application" %>
      </p>

      <p>
        Our team is ready to assist you with any questions or steps you need to
        finish. Act now to avoid starting the process from scratch.
      </p>

      <p>
        Best regards, <br />
